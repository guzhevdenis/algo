# Hoareâ€™s Partition Scheme works by initializing two indexes that
# start at two ends, the two indexes move toward each other until
# an inversion is (A smaller value on the left side and greater value on
#  the right side) found. When an inversion is found, two values are swapped
# and the process is repeated.
